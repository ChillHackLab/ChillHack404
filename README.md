# About This Repository

This repository contains **daily security research reports** published by **ChillHack404**.

Our focus is on **securing the network and the internet as a whole** — not only for technical professionals, but also for the general public.  
We believe security research should be **transparent, practical, and accessible**, so that risks can be understood and addressed before they are exploited.

All reports in this repository are based on **real-world observations, hands-on analysis, and defensive security research**.

## Our Mission

- Protect users and organizations from real-world security threats  
- Expose abusive, deceptive, or malicious software behavior  
- Bridge the gap between **technical security research** and **public internet safety**  
- Promote responsible disclosure and defensive awareness  

Security is not only for engineers — it is for everyone who uses the internet.
